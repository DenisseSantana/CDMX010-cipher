## 1. Preamble

Encrypt means to encrypt. The [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
it is one of the earliest known encryption methods. The Roman Emperor Julius Caesar used it to send secret orders to his generals in the fields of battle.

Caesar encryption is one of the simplest techniques to encrypt a message. It is a type of substitution cipher, that is, each letter of the original text is replaced by another that finds a fixed number of positions (scroll) later in the same alphabet.

For example, if we use an offset (_offset_) of 3 positions:

* The letter A is encrypted as D.
* The word HOME is encrypted as FDVD.
* Clear alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
* Encrypted alphabet: D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C

Today, all simple replacement ciphers are decrypted with very easily and, although in practice they do not offer much security in the communication by themselves; César encryption can be part of systems more complex encryption, such as Vigenère encryption, and even has application in the ROT13 system.

## 2. Project

It seeks to create a friendly and intuitive Web platform that allows coding and decode information based on the Caesar Cipher.

Similar to Ceasar cipher, it works by replacing each letter of the original text by another, that is ruled by a fixed number that will work as key to encode and decode the text.

Tis could be use between couples, or firends. That's why it's called "Between Us" it can only be enconded and decoded by the persons envolved.

**Duration:** 2 weeks.

**Methods:** 

* Research
* Desing Thinking

**Tools:** 
* HTML
* CSS
* Java Script

## 3. Context

Currently the world is facing an age of shared privacy, in the constitution there is a privacy law, by law everyone has the right to privacy, however, is it really protected? 
For this reason, the concept "Between Us" was born, a platform that allows to facilitate the encryption of texts and messages, so that way privacy really exists.

## 6. Retrospective

The project was quite a challenge, even though we had previously developed a project, even with some existing knowledge, the application of these in a different context was a great challenge. Especially the Java Script part, and some CSS parts.

The accompaniment of the Squad and the Coaches were a great support tool. I am proud of myself, given that a couple of weeks ago I would never have imagined being able to achieve this on my own.
